# File System Simulator
This program simulates a file system and provides basic functionality such as creating directories, changing directories, creating files and listing directories.

How to run the project
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
Download or clone the project repository.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the command python file_system_simulator.py to start the program.
Follow the prompts in the program to use the various commands (pwd, mkdir, cd, touch, ls, exit).
How to run tests
This project does not include tests.

Functionality
pwd: prints the current path.
mkdir: creates a new directory.
cd: change the current directory.
touch: creates a new file.
ls: prints the current directories.
exit: exits the program.
Note
The file system is stored in memory, so once the program ends, the created files system will be lost with it.
The program does not use any python built in data structure to create a file system, So you have to use a linked list, create one for your own use.
